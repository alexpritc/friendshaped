## About the project:
All aboard is a narrative murder mystery game with a time loop element.
It is designed to be replayed multiple times, with branching dialogue to make each play through unique, interesting characters to interact with, and a variety of secrets to uncover.

Whether you want to spend 5 minutes and play through once, or commit a whole evening to unravelling all of the twists and turns, All Aboard is the perfect escapism to relax at the end of a tiring day.

## About the team:
