They wear a Venetian mask and their heavy cloak smells of potent chemicals.

===StoctorWhatHappened
Hello doctor!#Player

(he nods solemnly) #Commentary

Right.#Player
Can I ask you a few questions?

...#Stoctor

What were you doing last night?#Player

I was in the dining cart having some drinks. #Stoctor

With the rest of us?#Player

Exactly!#Stoctor
But I got tired of everyone.
So I went to bed at 10 pm.

Fair enough. #Player
I do hope I didn't contribute to your early departure?

What do you mean?#Stoctor

You know... #Player
I said your mask made you look like the Lady's bird?

Oh that!#Stoctor
Yes, I'm afraid that didn't help.

Oops.#Player

Don't worry about it.#Stoctor
You're forgiven.

Thank you, Doctor.#Player
->StoctorIntro
===StoctorWhodunnit

So Doctor, do you have any suspicions as to who the culprit is?#Player
Any medical insight, perhaps, based on the body?

Well, you can never really be sure. #Stoctor
Not at this stage.
For all we know, it may have not even been a murder!

Oh really?#Player
I thought we were pretty sure!

Oh yes.#Stoctor
You see it all in the medical world.
For all we know, they had a medical issue that took them away unexpectedly. 
Things present in misleading ways.

(Hm. Isn't a bullet wound pretty obvious though?)#Commentary

Well, you are the expert, I suppose. #Player
I think I'll continue to treat this as suspicious circumstances, though.

===StoctorSecondStowaway
//if Doctor
So Doctor - #Player
What do think about the theory of a second stowaway?

What an ...interesting concept. #Stoctor

It was the Inspector's idea.#Player

Of course it was. #Stoctor
Well.
I suppose it could be possible?

Really?!#Player
I'm surprised an educated person such as yourself would consider it
Maybe the theory does hold some weight?

Perhaps.#Stoctor
If one person
- a criminal, at that -
could sneak on board, why not more?
It could be a whole family operation!

You think?#Player

A single stowaway would surely be discovered without someone to watch their back.#Stoctor
Only an idiot would try and sneak onto a fancy train like this without backup.

//if stowaway
->StoctorIntro

===StoctorSomeoneUp
The Steward heard someone up after bed last night.#Player

...Oh yes?#Stoctor

Yes.#Player
Moving from the rear sleeping cart 
Into the closet in the dining cart
And back again.

...#Stoctor
How very odd.

That's not even the odd part. #Player
The Steward said they seemed to be...
Dragging something. 

...#Stoctor
Oh yes!
Now you mention it, I know exactly what you mean!

You do?#Player

Yes!#Stoctor
It was me!
Taking some of my medical journals out of my bed-chambers. 
It's good to set up a rest/work divide, you know?

*['That's odd. No journals were found.']
->ThatsOdd
*['I was thinking it sounded more like a body was being dragged.']
->ABody

=ThatsOdd
That's odd. #Player
No journals were found.

Well yes I of course moved them back into my room this morning!!#Stoctor
I need them to do my medicine work!
You know how we Doctors are!
Now I must get back to those books, if you don't mind!
->StoctorIntro

=ABody
I was thinking it sounded more like a body being dragged.#Player

...#Stoctor
YOU'RE RIGHT 

Really?!#Player
How do you know?
Did you-

NO!#Stoctor
Okay, here's the truth
I'm the stowaway.
But I didn't kill anyone!

But the stowaway was found dead?#Player
You're the doctor!

I'm pretending to be the doctor!#Stoctor
I was ...going through everyone's rooms while you were at the party 
The Doctor came back while I was in their room so I hid in the closet
While I was in there someone came into his room and killed them!

...This is a lot of new information. #Player

I know!#Stoctor
It's been a helluva day!
All I know is someone came in and killed the poor fella
I made the best of a bad situation
Swapped our clothes over 
And took their body to the dining cart so it wouldn't be found with me 
I'm a thief but not a murderer, I swear!

I mean #Player
This explains why you made no sense when I asked about doctor stuff.

Haha yeah #Stoctor
Soz

===StoctorConductorSus
=Doctor
The Lady thinks the Conductor is suspicious. #Player
What do you think?

Well, wasn't she in the engine room? #Stoctor
I doubt someone could sneak around this train unnoticed...
->StoctorIntro
=Stowaway
The Lady thinks the Conductor is suspicious. #Player
What do you think?

Well...#Stoctor
From... 
...personal experience...
There are lots of ways to move around this train unnoticed
Or she certainly knows the train well enough.

What valuable insight!#Player

But I don't think she had anything to do with this #Stoctor
She doesn't seem like a bad egg
The staff all speak highly of her,
always a good sign. 
->StoctorIntro
There's word that the Lady is hiding something. 
What do you make of that?
===StoctorLadySus
{StoctorSomeoneUp.ABody:
//if hes been revealed
I have no idea if she has anything to do with this, I'm afraid. #Stoctor
She's certainly not a very nice woman
She's the type I would happily rob without remorse
Eat the rich, ya know?

Eh, I think she'd just taste bitter #Player

You're probably right. #Stoctor
-else:
Well... #Stoctor
Not to speak ill of such a charming woman
But I do happen to know she's on some pretty intense medication
Side effects of mood swings and violent outbursts are very common!

Oh wow! #Player
That could explain some things.
How do you know which pills she's taking?
Did you prescribe them?

...#Stoctor
No.
I just know. 

..?#Player

It's a doctor thing, you wouldn't understand#Stoctor

Hm.#Player
Right.
(Well that's a load of nonsense.)#Commentary

}

->StoctorIntro

===StoctorInspectorSus
The Steward thinks that Sands might have something to do with this. #Player
What do you think?

{StoctorSomeoneUp.ABody:
//if hes been revealed
I think that's a pretty good theory actually! #Stoctor

Really?#Player
What makes you say that?

Well, when I was hidden in the closet #Stoctor
And the doctor was in the room 
I heard the footsteps of the person who came in and killed him!!
They came from the back of the train -
The only things in that direction are the toilet and the Inspectors bed-chambers

That does look pretty suspicious #Player

Yep.#Stoctor

*[Ask if someone could have come from the bathroom]

*[Ask if he thinks the Inspector could murder]
->SandsMurder

-else:
The Inspector?#Stoctor
No way!
He is one good law-abiding citizen
He loves the law
As do I!
He's not exactly some pick-pocket criminal now, is he
}
=Bathroom
Do you think someone could have come from the bathroom?#Player

Hm...#Stoctor
Now you mention it
You know those 'alternative routes' I mentioned?
You didn't hear it from me but you can access the roof from the bathroom windows...
So TECHNICALLY...
It could have been anyone
->StoctorIntro
=SandsMurder
Do you think the Inspector is capable of murder?#Player

I honestly have no clue.#Stoctor
I have heard other passengers saying his business is doing poorly these days 
Perhaps he wanted to create a mystery to solve?
I know what those high-class folk are like
They'll do anything to make themselves rich
