===LadyDescription
Lady Mortimer is an elderly lady and quite the character.  #Commentary
She wears a gold bird cage as a head ornament (which she insists isn't a hat) so she can be close to her dearest pet conure at all times.

===LadyWhatHappened
Good morning, Lady Mortimer. #Player
May I call you Mort for short?

You may certainly not!#Lady

Fair enough. #Player
Can you describe to me what happened last night?

I suppose. #Lady
I was trying to enjoy a quiet drink with my dear friend Mr Lionel. 

I don't think I've met Mr Lionel, is he another passenger?#Player

Well of course you've met him, he's right here! (she gestures to the conure on her head)#Lady

...Of course. #Player
Sorry. 
Do go on. 

Anyway. #Lady
We were trying to have a quiet drink but the dining cart was awfully loud. 
Everyone on this train has terrible manners on this train, you know.
We were about to leave anyway when that dreadful Inspector spilled a drink near me!
I avoided it, of course
But gave him a telling off nonetheless. 

I'm sure you did. #Player

Quite. #Lady
Once he ran off I also retired to my bed chambers. 
Mr Lionel was quite shaken up by the whole ordeal so I had to tend to him. 

Are you feeling better now, Mr Lionel?#Player

...He's a bird. #Lady
He can't talk. 

Of course, apologies. #Player

...imbecile...#Lady

===LadyWhodunnit
I get the sense you're a well travelled woman, Lady Mortimer. #Player

I've seen some things in my time, yes. #Lady

Who do you think could have murdered that poor man?#Player

Oh I dread to think of it!#Lady
A woman mustn't think of such horrible things!

I'm sorry I aske-#Player

No! #Lady
It's too late, I'm devastated!

(she wipes away a tear)

To talk of death this way, it's so crude!
Some people have no respect for life. 
We have to go. 
We don't have time for such vulgar conversation. 

My apologies, Lady Mortimer. #Player

===LadySecondStowaway
What do you make of the detectives theory?#Player
That there is a second stowaway on board
And they committed the murder?

Sands thought of that?#Lady
...I guess it makes a certain amount of sense.

What makes you say that?#Player

Well the staff on these trains change so frequently#Lady

Oh really?#Player

Oh yes, it seems the Conductor struggles to keep her people in check...#Lady
So it wouldn't be too hard for one of them to sneak someone on board. 
Unnoticed. 

Interesting point#Player
I'll keep that in mind.

You do that.#Lady

===LadySomeonesUp
The Steward says someone was up late last night. #Player
After everyone else went to bed. 

Oh really?#Lady

Yes.#Player
Were you up at all past midnight, Ma'am?

Oh no, dear. #Lady
I need my sleep. 
I spent a while comforting Mr Lionel
He refused to settle down last night!
And when he eventually calmed down I was out like a light.
