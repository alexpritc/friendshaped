Lady Mortimer is an elderly lady and quite the character.  #Commentary
She wears a gold birdcage as a head ornament (which she insists isn't a hat) so she can be close to her dearest pet bird at all times.

===LadyWhatHappened
Good morning, Lady Mortimer. #Player
May I call you Mort for short?

You may certainly not!#Lady

Fair enough. #Player
Can you describe to me what happened last night?

I suppose. #Lady
I was trying to enjoy a quiet drink with my dear friend Mr. Lionel. 

I don't think I've met Mr. Lionel, is he another passenger?#Player

Well of course you've met him, he's right here! (she gestures to the bird on her head)#Lady

...Of course. #Player
Sorry. 
Do go on. 

Anyway. #Lady
We were trying to have a quiet drink but the dining cart was awfully loud. 
Everyone on this train has terrible manners on this train, you know.
We were about to leave anyway when that dreadful Inspector spilled a drink near me!
I avoided it, of course
But gave him a telling off nonetheless. 

I'm sure you did. #Player

Quite. #Lady
Once he ran off I also retired to my bed chambers. 
Mr. Lionel was quite shaken up by the whole ordeal so I had to tend to him. 

Are you feeling better now, Mr. Lionel?#Player

...He's a bird. #Lady
He can't talk. 

Of course, apologies. #Player

...imbecile...#Lady

===LadyWhodunnit
I get the sense you're a well-traveled woman, Lady Mortimer. #Player

I've seen some things in my time, yes. #Lady

Who do you think could have murdered that poor man?#Player

Oh I dread to think of it!#Lady
A woman mustn't think of such horrible things!

I'm sorry I aske-#Player

No! #Lady
It's too late, I'm devastated!

(she wipes away a tear)

To talk of death this way, it's so crude!
Some people have no respect for life. 
We have to go. 
We don't have time for such vulgar conversation. 

My apologies, Lady Mortimer. #Player
->LadyIntro

===LadySecondStowaway
What do you make of the detective's theory?#Player
That there is a second stowaway on board
And they committed the murder?

Sands thought of that?#Lady
...I guess it makes a certain amount of sense.

What makes you say that?#Player

Well the staff on these trains change so frequently#Lady

Oh really?#Player

Oh yes, it seems the Conductor struggles to keep her people in check...#Lady
So it wouldn't be too hard for one of them to sneak someone on board. 
Unnoticed. 

Interesting point#Player
I'll keep that in mind.

You do that.#Lady
->LadyIntro

===LadySomeonesUp
The Steward says someone was up late last night. #Player
After everyone else went to bed. 

Oh really?#Lady

Yes.#Player
Were you up at all past midnight, Ma'am?

Oh no, dear. #Lady
I need my sleep. 
I spent a while comforting Mr. Lionel
He refused to settle down last night!
And when he eventually calmed down around 3 am I was out like a light. 
->LadyIntro


===LadyStoctor
Did you hear about the stowaway disguising themselves as the Doctor? #Player

I most certainly did!#Lady
Awful news.
But nice to have this whole ordeal wrapped up and done with. 

Well, not exactly. #Player
We still don't know who murdered the real Doctor.

Do we not?! #Lady
Are you seriously believing that thief's story??
They must be the murderer, it's the only thing that makes sense!

I guess their closet story is a bit far fetched...#Player

And what's more, #Lady
They probably had an accomplice!
Someone on the staff to sneak them in!

...Like who? #Player

Someone high up... #Lady
With connections...
Doesn't it seem odd to you that you haven't seen the conductor's face since boarding?
She's been awfully quiet...
Holed away in the engine room...
I often hear her talking in there. 
She's either a lunatic who talks to herself...
Or she's been hiding someone...

===LadySus
Lady Mortimer, the Inspector thinks you are hiding something #Player
Care to comment?

Oh that old buffoon thinks I'm suspicious?#Lady
I wouldn't take his word for it dear 
He talks the talk but I hear he's been out of work for a long time
He's not exactly in demand these days

->LastNight
*[Agree that Sands is talking rubbish]
->SandsRubbish
=LastNight
Can you clarify exactly what you did last night after you went to bed?#Player

I'VE TOLD YOU ALREADY!#Lady
Mr. Lionel was being restless
He wouldn't stop squawking until about 2 in the morning!
...Not that I mind looking after a dear friend, of course.

Of course not. #Player
So you just stayed in and looked after him?

Yes! #Lady
For hours!
Now please let us be or he'll be just as bad tonight. 
->LadyIntro
=SandsRubbish
You're right, Lady Mortimer #Player
I don't know why I would consider anything that man suggested

Finally, some sense!#Lady
I was beginning to think everyone on this train had lost their minds
Why, just last night the staff forgot to bring me my night-time tea!
This institution is going to the dogs, I tell you
->LadyIntro

===LadyInspectorSus
The Steward thinks the Inspector is to blame. #Player
What do you think?

Hm… #Lady
I suppose he was in the cart next to the victim
and it would explain why such a ‘good PI’ somehow has no clue how the murder occurred under his nose…
