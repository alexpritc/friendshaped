Lady Mortimer is an elderly lady and quite the character. 
She wears a gold bird cage as a head ornament (which she insists isn't a hat) so she can be close to her dearest pet conure at all times.

===LadyWhatHappened
Good morning, Lady Mortimer. 
May I call you Mort for short?

You may certainly not!

Fair enough. 
Can you describe to me what happened last night?

I suppose. 
I was trying to enjoy a quiet drink with my dear friend Mr Lionel. 

I don't think I've met Mr Lionel, is he another passenger?

Well of course you've met him, he's right here! (she guestures to the conure on her head)

...Of course. 
Sorry. 
Do go on. 

Anyway. 
We were trying to have a quiet drink but the dining cart was awfully loud. 
Everyone on this train has terrible manners on this train, you know.
We were about to leave anyway when that dreadful Inspector spilled a drink near me!
I avoided it, of course
But gave him a telling off nonetheless. 

I'm sure you did. 

Quite. 
Once he ran off I also retired to my bed chambers. 
Mr Lionel was quite shaken up by the whole ordeal so I had to tend to him. 

Are you feeling better now, Mr Lionel?

...He's a bird. 
He can't talk. 

Of course, apologies. 

...imbecile...

===LadyWhodunnit
I get the sense you're a well travelled woman, Lady Mortimer. 

I've seen some things in my time, yes. 

Who do you think could have murdered that poor man?

Oh I dread to think of it!
A woman mustn't think of such horrible things!

I'm sorry I aske-

No! 
It's too late, I'm devastated!

(she wipes away a tear that isn't there)

To talk of death this way, it's so crude!
Some people have no respect for life. 
We have to go. 
We don't have time for such vulgar conversation. 

My apologies, Lady Mortimer.
