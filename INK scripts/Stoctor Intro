The Doctor is a quiet fellow who tends to blend into the background.
He wears a venetion mask and his heavy cloak smells of potent chemicals.

Hello doctor!

(he nods solomnly)

Right.
Can I ask you a few questions?

...

What were you doing last night?

I was in the dining cart having some drinks. 

With the rest of us?

Exactly!
But I got tired of everyone.
So I went to bed at 10pm.

Fair enough. 
I do hope I didn't contribute to your early departure?

What do you mean?

You know... 
I said your mask made you look like the Lady's bird?

Oh that!
Yes I'm afraid that didn't help.

Oops.

Don't worry about it.
You're forgiven.

Thank you, Doctor.

So Doctor, do you have any suspicions as to who the culprit is?
Any medical insight, perhaps, based on the body?

Well, you can never really be sure. 
Not at this stage.
For all we know, it may have not even been a murder!

Oh really?
I thought we were pretty sure!

Oh yes.
You see it all in the medical world.
For all we know, he had a medical issue which took him away unexpectedly. 
Things present in misleading ways.

(Hm. Isn't a bullet wound pretty obvious though?)

Well, you are the expert, I suppose. 
I think I'll continue to treat this as suspicious circumstances, though.

//if Doctor
So Doctor - 
What do think about the theory of a second stowaway?

What an ...interesting concept. 

It was the Inspector's idea.

Of course it was. 
Well.
I suppose it could be possible?

Really?!
I'm surprised an educated man such as youself would consider it
Maybe the theory does hold some weight?

Perhaps.
If one person
- a criminal, at that -
could sneak on board, why not more?
It could be a whole family operation!

You think?

A single stowaway would surely be discovered without someone to watch their back.
Only an idiot would try and sneak onto a fancy train like this without backup.
