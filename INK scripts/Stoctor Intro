===StoctorDescription
The Doctor is a quiet fellow who tends to blend into the background.  #Commentary
He wears a venetion mask and his heavy cloak smells of potent chemicals.

===StoctorWhatHappened
Hello doctor!#Player

(he nods solomnly) #Commentary

Right.#Player
Can I ask you a few questions?

...#Stoctor

What were you doing last night?#Player

I was in the dining cart having some drinks. #Stoctor

With the rest of us?#Player

Exactly!#Stoctor
But I got tired of everyone.
So I went to bed at 10pm.

Fair enough. #Player
I do hope I didn't contribute to your early departure?

What do you mean?#Stoctor

You know... #Player
I said your mask made you look like the Lady's bird?

Oh that!#Stoctor
Yes I'm afraid that didn't help.

Oops.#Player

Don't worry about it.#Stoctor
You're forgiven.

Thank you, Doctor.#Player
->StoctorIntro
===StoctorWhodunnit

So Doctor, do you have any suspicions as to who the culprit is?#Player
Any medical insight, perhaps, based on the body?

Well, you can never really be sure. #Stoctor
Not at this stage.
For all we know, it may have not even been a murder!

Oh really?#Player
I thought we were pretty sure!

Oh yes.#Stoctor
You see it all in the medical world.
For all we know, he had a medical issue which took him away unexpectedly. 
Things present in misleading ways.

(Hm. Isn't a bullet wound pretty obvious though?)#Commentary

Well, you are the expert, I suppose. #Player
I think I'll continue to treat this as suspicious circumstances, though.

===StoctorSecondStowaway
//if Doctor
So Doctor - #Player
What do think about the theory of a second stowaway?

What an ...interesting concept. #Stoctor

It was the Inspector's idea.#Player

Of course it was. #Stoctor
Well.
I suppose it could be possible?

Really?!#Player
I'm surprised an educated man such as youself would consider it
Maybe the theory does hold some weight?

Perhaps.#Stoctor
If one person
- a criminal, at that -
could sneak on board, why not more?
It could be a whole family operation!

You think?#Player

A single stowaway would surely be discovered without someone to watch their back.#Stoctor
Only an idiot would try and sneak onto a fancy train like this without backup.

===StoctorSomeoneUp
The Steward saw someone up after bed last night.#Player

...Oh yes?#Stoctor

Yes.#Player
Moving from the rear sleeping cart 
Past the staff quarters
And back again.

...#Stoctor
How very odd.

That's not even the odd part. #Player
The Steward said they appeared to be...
Dragging something. 

...#Stoctor
Oh yes!
Now you mention it, I know exactly what you mean!

You do?#Player

Yes!#Stoctor
It was me!
Taking some of my medical journals out of my bedchambers. 
It good to set up a rest/work divide, you know?

*['That's odd. No journals were found.']
->ThatsOdd
*['I was thinking it sounded more like a body was being dragged.']
->ABody

=ThatsOdd
That's odd. #Player
No journals were found.

Well yes I of course moved them back into my room this morning!!#Stoctor
I need them to do my medicine work!
You know how us Doctors are!
Now I must get back to those books, if you don't mind!
->StoctorIntro

=ABody
I was thinking it sounded more like a body being dragged.#Player

...#Stoctor
YOU'RE RIGHT 

Really?!#Player
How do you know?
Did you-

NO!#Stoctor
Okay, here's the truth
I'm the stowaway.
But I didn't kill anyone!

But the stowaway was found dead?#Player
You're the doctor!

I'm pretending to be the doctor!#Stoctor
I was ...going through everyones rooms while you were at the party 
The Doctor came back while I was in his room so I hid in the closet
While I was in there someone came into his room and killed him!

...This is a lot of new information. #Player

I know!#Stoctor
It's been a helluva day!
All I know is someone came in and killed the guy 
I made the best of a bad situation
Swapped our clothes over 
And took his body to the dining cart so it wouldn't be found with me 
I'm a thief but not a murderer, I swear!

I mean #Player
This explains why you made no sense when I asked about doctor stuff.

Haha yeah #Stoctor
Soz

===StoctorConductorSus
=Doctor
The Lady thinks the Conductor is suspicious. #Player
What do you think?

Well, wasn't she in the engine room? #Stoctor
I doubt someone could sneak around this train unnoticed...
->StoctorIntro
=Stowaway
The Lady thinks the Conductor is suspicious. #Player
What do you think?

Well...#Stoctor
From... 
...personal experience...
There are lots of ways to move around this train unnoticed
Or she certainly knows the train well enough.

What valuable insight!#Player

But I don't think she had anything to do with this #Stoctor
She doesn't seem like a bad egg
The staff all speak highly of her,
always a good sign.
