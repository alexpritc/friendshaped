===StewardDescription
The Steward is a young man who clearly isn't too enthused with his job but can't afford to get fired.  #Commentary
He isn't very good at controlling his facial expressions so wears a face mask to keep them hidden and avoid trouble.

===StewardWhatHappened
Good morning Mr Steward sir!#Player

...Good Morning?#Steward

Working hard or hardly working, amiright?#Player

...there's been a murder. #Steward
Why are you being like this?

Yes.#Player
Well.
That's why I'm here!

Hm?#Steward

Can you explain what you were up to last night?#Player

Sure.#Steward
Well as I'm sure you remember most of the passengers were taking drinks in the dining cart last night. 
I don't do bar work,
I'm more of a 'here when you need me' type guy.
So I was resting in the staff quarters for most of the night.

 ===StewardSatThere
You were just sat there, waiting to be called upon, the whole night?#Player

No one needed my services, I guess. #Steward

Fair enough I guess. #Player
Thanks for your help.

->StewardIntro

===StewardCoverUp
This all sounds awfully bland. #Player

Yeah, and?#Steward
That's the job. 
It's not exactly thrilling. 

I don't know, Steward. #Player
It sounds to me like I'm not getting the full story.

What are you suggesting?!#Steward

Did you see something?#Player
Are you covering for the murderer?!

WHAT?#Steward
NO!
..Fine.
I haven't been completely honest.

I knew it!#Player

-but it's nothing like that!#Steward
It's just...
Sometimes...
When none of the passengers need me...

SPIT IT OUT MAN#Player

I TAKE NAPS IN THE STAFF ROOM OKAY!#Steward

Oh buddy.#Player

Yeah. #Steward
I'm not proud. 
I wasn't even asleep for long this time though!
I was woken up around 11.30, I was barely out for 20 minutes!

That's more than enough time for you to miss something!#Player
What woke you up?

There were birds screeching on top of the train. #Steward
Must have been going through a flock of them or something?
I don't know anything about birds but they were bloody loud. 

Not a fun way to wake up#Player
But you kinda deserved it.

Yeah I know. #Steward
...
Please don't tell anyone I nap. 

No promises.#Player

->StewardIntro
===StewardWhatHappenedAgain
So Steward,#Player
Now I know your...
sleepy secret...
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

Like what?#Steward
Didn't we already do this?

*['Did you do anything else last night?']
->DoAnything
*['Did you see anyone else last night?']
->SeeAnything

=DoAnything
Did you do anything else last night?#Player
Are you sure you're telling me everything?
I won't be mad
(but I might be disappointed)

I've told you everything I did last night!#Steward
I was in the staff room 
Had a shameful nap 
Woke up and continued to keep an eye out for guests!

Nothing else?#Player

No!#Steward
This doesn't seem like a good use of your time,
Asking me the same questions over and over!
->StewardIntro

=SeeAnything
Did you see anyoneone else last night? #Player

Let me think...#Steward
Lady Mortimer walked by at about... 20 past ten?

And you were still awake at that time?#Player

Yes!#Steward
I must've drifted off not long after that though...

Until you were woken up by the bird noises?#Player

Exactly!#Steward
That was at about half 11.
Then nothing happened for a while

But you didn't fall asleep again?#Player

...I don't think so?#Steward
No?
I'm pretty sure I didn't...
Either way,
I didn't see anyone else until gone midnight. 
Maybe 12.30?

Who did you see?#Player

I couldn't make them out #Steward
But they came from the rear sleeping cart 
Walked past the door dragging something
And then went back in the direction they came 

AND YOU DIDN'T THINK TO LOOK INTO IT?!#Player

I'm here if passengers request me!#Steward
I don't go out of my way to see if they need help dragging their things around the train!
Why does it matter?

BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BODY!!#Player

Oh. 
Ew. 

//SOMEONE IS UP AFTER BED PROMPT UNLOCKED
->StewardIntro

===StewardWhodunnit
So you must have a pretty good take on everyone on this train, right?#Player

I guess?#Steward

If you had to pick someone, who would you suspect murdered the poor man?#Player

I don't know the passengers that well!#Steward
I know who takes tea before bed, not who has a homicidal streak!

Well that's less useful. #Player
Do you have any suggestions?

Hm. #Steward
Well. 
No one walked towards the end of the train after the Lady went to bed
And the stowaway was found dead in the dining cart
So I'd assume it was someone who sleeps in the rear of the train?
Perhaps Sands, he seems awfully interested in this whole thing. 

// SANDS IS SUS UNLOCKED

Good idea, Steward!#Player

Thanks?#Steward

One more thing...#Player

Yes?#Steward

Who takes tea before bed?#Player

Oh. #Steward
Lady Mortimer. 
She says she needs it to fall asleep. 

Fair enough. #Player
Ladies do like tea. 


->StewardIntro

===StewardSecondStowaway
Do you think a second stowaway could have committed the murder?#Player

Hm.#Steward
I doubt it.
It's a small train, I can't imagine multiple people would go unnoticed. 
...but to be fair, I didn't think there would be one stowaway in the first place
...until that body showed up.

It is a bit of a plot twist, eh?#Player

Yeah.#Steward
I feel for the Conductor 
- she normally runs such a tight ship.
She can't be feeling good about having not noticed a stowaway

Let alone a murdered stowaway.#Player

Exactly. #Steward

->StewardIntro

===StewardStoctor
Hey Steward! #Player
Did you hear about the Doctor?
Well, the Stowaway/Doctor.
Stocter, if you will?

I heard. #Steward
So it was a body I saw being dragged...

Yep. #Player

... #Steward
I'm just not going to think about it. 
It's fine. 
I'm fine. 

->StewardIntro

===StewardConductorSus
The Lady thinks that the Conductor is suspicious. #Player
What do you reckon?

Nah I don't think she would have anything to do with something like this. #Steward
She's a good person
And a good boss.
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

*[Ask how long they've worked together]
->History  
*[Suggest he's covering for the Conductor]
->Covering

=History
You speak highly of her. #Player
How long have you worked together?

Almost a year now, I think?#Steward
She has her quirks, for sure.
She has her... secrets
But I've always enjoyed working with her
She makes it fun, ya'know?
->StewardIntro
=Covering
Are you maybe... #Player
Covering for the conductor?

What a ridiculous suggestion! #Steward
This job doesn't pay well enough to buy my silence!!
Certainly not on something serious like this!
