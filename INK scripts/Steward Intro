The Steward is a young man who clearly isn't too enthused with his job but can't afford to get fired. 
He isn't very good at controlling his facial expressions so wears a face mask to keep them hidden and avoid trouble.

===StewardWhatHappened
Good morning Mr Steward sir!

...Good Morning?

Working hard or hardly working, amiright?

...there's been a murder. 
Why are you being like this?

Yes.
Well.
That's why I'm here!

Hm?

Can you explain what you were up to last night?

Sure.
Well as I'm sure you remember most of the passengers were taking drinks in the dining cart last night. 
I don't do bar work,
I'm more of a 'here when you need me' type guy.
So I was resting in the staff quarters for most of the night.

 ===StewardSatThere
You were just sat there, waiting to be called upon, the whole night?

(he shrugged)
No one needed my services, I guess. 
No one even passed by the door apart from Lady Mortimer when she went to bed. 

Fair enough I guess. 
Thanks for your help.

===StewardCoverUp
This all sounds awfully bland. 

Yeah, and?
That's the job. 
It's not exactly thrilling. 

I don't know, Steward. 
It sounds to me like I'm not getting the full story.

What are you suggesting?!

Did you see something?
Are you covering for the murderer?!

WHAT?
NO!
..Fine.
I haven't been completely honest.

I knew it!

-but it's nothing like that!
It's just...
Sometimes...
When none of the passengers need me...

SPIT IT OUT man

I TAKE NAPS IN THE STAFF ROOM OKAY!

Oh buddy.

Yeah. 
I'm not proud. 
I wasn't even asleep for long this time though!
I was woken up around 11.30, I was barely out for 20 minutes!

That's more than enough time for you to miss something!
What woke you up?

There were birds screeching on top of the train. 
Must have been going through a flock of them or something?
I don't know anything about birds but they were bloody loud. 

Not a fun way to wake upon
But you kinda deserved it.

Yeah I know. 
...
Please don't tell anyone I nap. 

No promises.


->StewardIntro
===StewardWhodunnit
So you must have a pretty good take on everyone on this train, right?

I guess?

If you had to pick someone, who would you suspect murdered the poor man?

I don't know the passengers that well!
I know who takes tea before bed, not who has a homicidal streak!

Well that's less useful. 
Do you have any suggestions?

Hm. 
Well. 
No one walked past my door after Lady Mortimer went to bed
And the stowaway was found dead in the dining cart
So I'd assume it was someone who sleeps in the rear of the train?
Perhaps Sands, he seems awfully interested in this whole thing. 

// SANDS IS SUS UNLOCKED

Good idea, Steward!

Thanks?

One more thing...

Yes?

Who takes tea before bed?

Oh. 
Lady Mortimer. 
She says she needs it to fall asleep. 

Fair enough. 
Ladies do like tea. 


->StewardIntro

===StewardSecondStowaway
Do you think a second stowaway could have committed the murder?

Hm.
I doubt it.
It's a small train, I can't imagine multiple people would go unnoticed. 
...but to be fair, I didn't think there would be one stowaway in the first place
...until that body showed up.

It is a bit of a plot twist, eh?

Yeah.
I feel for the Conductor 
- she normally runs such a tight ship.
She can't be feeling good about having not noticed a stowaway

Let alone a murdered stowaway.

Exactly.
