===SandsDescription
Inspector Sands is a middle aged gentlemen, a P.I (and a hack one at that).  # Commentary
He wears a pair of old suspenders and carries a magnifying glass everywhere he goes, like he belongs in a cartoon.

===SandsWhatHappened
So, Inspector. #Player
What were you doing last night?

I was... #Inspector
indulging...
at the bar with everyone else.
I remember having a rousing debate with you about the proper pronunciation of 'scone'

Ah yes, Inspector, I remember that well.#Player
I guess we're all entitled to our opinions...
(even if they are wrong)...

Yes quite.#Inspector
Anyway 
At some point Docor squashed passed me on his way back to his bedchambers...
Which made me spill my drink on Lady Mortimer

Yikes#Player

Yep.#Inspector
She was not best pleased so I escaped away to my own bed shortly afterwards.

That sounds like a smart move.#Player

Yes, I thought so.#Inspector
I've seen a lot in my time 
But that woman is something else

->SandsIntro

===SandsWhodunnit
So I hear you are something of a detective, Sands?#Player

You heard right! #Inspector
I'm a professional don't you know 
And I'm very discreet

I'm sure!#Player
So what do you make of all of this?
Who do you think committed this crime?

I was wondering when you'd ask me!#Inspector
You learn a lot in this line of work
Namely:
It's always the spouse. 

(...but the body found was a stowaway?)#Player
->SECONDSTOWAWAY
=SECONDSTOWAWAY
Exactly!#Inspector
So there must be a SECOND STOWAWAY! 
A marital murder!
Case closed. 

* ['That's a ridiculous idea.']
 -> SandsWhodunnitRidiculous
 * [Agree with him.]
 -> SandsWhodunnitAgree

===SandsWhodunnitRidiculous
Hm. #Player
Isn't that a bit of a stretch, Inspector?

hsdafgdsa#Inspector
You wanted my expert opinion!
How dare you question me!

I'm just sayi-#Player

No!#Inspector
For all we know it was probably you!
Why else would you try and discredit a professional like myself??
I've got my eye on you lad.

I'm not a lad I'm a cyborg. #Player

You're an idiot, that's what you are.#Inspector
You don't want to be my enemy.
Trust me. 
->SandsIntro

===SandsWhodunnitAgree
Ah of course!#Player
What a splendid theory, Sands!

Thank you, lass!#Inspector
This is my job after all!

I'm not a lass I'm a cyborg. #Player

You're a damn genius, that's what you are!#Inspector
I have your back, no matter what. 
We detectives gotta stick together, eh?
->SandsIntro
===SandsSomeonesUp
Someone was seen late last night#Player
After everyone had gone to bed 
Walking into the dining cart and back again.

Oh really?#Inspector
How intriguing!

Yes.#Player
And they seemed to be...
Dragging something. 

Curious!#Inspector
But why do you bring this up?

Well, Inspector.#Player
I suspect they may have been dragging...
THE BODY! 
Which would suggest the murder took place in the rear sleeping carriage. 

But that's where I sleep!#Inspector

...#Player

Proposterous suggestion!#Inspector
You are saying the murder took place in the same carriage I was in?
I would have been able to stop it!

Even if you were asleep?#Player

CRIME NEVER SLEEPS AND NEITHER DO I!#Inspector
...and if I did sleep I wouldn't sleep through that!


->SandsIntro

===SandsStoctor
Inspector, have you heard?#Player
There's been a new lead in the case!

Well don't just babble on, what is it man?! #Inspector

The Doctor is actually the stowaway in disguise! #Player
And the body found in the dining cart is the real Doctor!

Pfffft #Inspector
What are you on about?
That's a load of tripe

It's true, Inspector! #Player

Naaah. #Inspector
I was talking to the Doctor just earlier this morning!
He is no imposter!
Detective work is my job, I can spot a liar.

Oh really?
Are you sure about that? #Player

Yes! #Inspector
The Doctor is 100% legitimate!
That old lady though...

Hm? #Player

There's something not right about that woman... #Inspector
I think she's hiding something...

//LADY IS SUS UNLOCKED

->SandsIntro

===SandsConductorSus
 Did you hear the Lady thinks the Conductor is suspicious?#Player
 
 The Conductor? #Inspector
 Nah I'm pretty sure she needs to drive the train. 
 I mean, its not like she can just leave the engine alone, especially on a complicated journey like this! 
 
 (This is a non-stop journey...)#Player
 (Maybe she did have something to do with this?)

->SandsIntro

===InspectorSus
The Steward thinks you may have had a hand in this case. #Player
Care to comment?

What an absurd accusation!#Inspector
How dare you try and tarnish my stellar reputation?!
It could have been anyone!
The Steward is blaming me eh?
Maybe it was him!

I don't think 'he who smelt it dealt it' applies here, Inspector #Player

TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!#Inspector
I AM!
There is a murderer on this train and the longer you question me the longer they're free!
