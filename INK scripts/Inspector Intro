===SandsDescription
Inspector Sands is a middle aged gentlemen, a P.I (and a hack one at that). 
He wears a brown trench coat and carries a magnifying glass everywhere he goes, like he belongs in a cartoon.

===SandsWhatHappened
So, Inspector. 
What were you doing last night?

I was... 
indulging...
at the bar with everyone else.
I remember having a rousing debate with you about the proper pronunciation of 'scone'

Ah yes, Inspector, I remember that well.
I guess we're all entitled to our opinions...
(even if they are wrong)...

Yes quite.
Anyway 
At some point Docor squashed passed me on his way back to his bedchambers...
Which made me spill my drink on Lady Mortimer

Yikes

Yep.
She was not best pleased so I escaped away to my own bed shortly afterwards.

That sounds like a smart move.

Yes, I thought so.
I've seen a lot in my time 
But that woman is something else

===SandsWhodunnit
So I hear you are something of a detective yourself, Sands?

You heard right! 
I'm a professional don't you know 
And I'm very discreet

I'm sure!
So what do you make of all of this?
Who do you think committed this crime?

I was wondering when you'd ask me!
You learn a lot in this line of work
Namely:
It's always the spouse. 

...but the body found was a stowaway?
->SECONDSTOWAWAY
=SECONDSTOWAWAY
Exactly!
So there must be a SECOND STOWAWAY! 
A marital murder!
Case closed.

 * [Agree with him.]

===SandsWhodunnitRidiculous
Hm. 
Isn't that a bit of a stretch, Inspector?

hsdafgdsa
You wanted my expert opinion!
How dare you question me!

I'm just sayi-

No!
For all we know it was probably you!
Why else would you try and discredit a professional like myself??
I've got my eye on you lad.

I'm not a lad I'm a robot. 

You're an idiot, that's what you are.
You don't want to be my enemy.
Trust me. 
->SandsIntro

===SandsWhodunnitAgree
Ah of course!
What a splendid theory, Sands!

Thank you, lass!
This is my job after all!

I'm not a lass I'm a robot. 

You're a damn genius, that's what you are!
I have your back, no matter what. 
We detectives gotta stick together, eh?
