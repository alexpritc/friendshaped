===ConductorDescription
The Conductor is a middle-aged woman who is very proud of this train. #Commentary
She thinks she is a sea captain, and although you haven't seen her since boarding the train, other passengers say she wears an old sailors hat on her head. 
You talk to her through a rusty intercom.

===ConductorWhatHappened
Hello? #Player
Is this thing on?

-Bzzt-#Conductor
Roger! 
This is the Conductor, at your service!
How can I help you?

Hello Mrs Conductor Lady!#Player

Oh please, no need for the formalities!#Conductor
Call me Captain!

...Like, a boat captain?#Player

Exactly!#Conductor
Now what do you want, skipper?
I'm pretty busy up here!

I wanted to ask you what happened last night as you remember it?#Player

Of course!#Conductor
Well, naturally, I was stuck in here the whole night
(I always miss out on the parties)
But I heard you guests had a...
Shindig?
Is that what the kids call it these days?

Shindig is good. #Player
Or soiree.
Both very hip.

Right!#Conductor
Well all I know is the booze supplies took quite a hit
Always brings out the worst in people, it seems.

That matches up with what I remember. #Player
So you were really stuck in there the whole time?

I'm afraid so, skipper#Conductor
We do get awfully bored

We?#Player

...We as in me!#Conductor
The royal we!

...That's not a thing.#Player

->ConductorIntro
===ConductorWhodunnit
As the head of this fine locomotive-#Player

She's more than fine she is superb!#Conductor

She is indeed!#Player
Well, do you have any idea who may have done this?

I'm afraid not#Conductor
Being holed up in here we haven't seen much of the action.
But rest assured they will be dealt with when we arrive!
You have my word.

I appreciate that.#Player

=ConductorSuggestSteward
One more thing -#Conductor
You should talk to someone more involved. 
Maybe the Steward.

Hm?#Player

Yes, he's a good lad.#Conductor
A bit odd, Perhaps
But I trust him wholeheartedly.
->ConductorWhodunnitEnd
=ConductorWhodunnitEnd

Thank you for all your help.#Player

No problemo, skipper.#Conductor

===ConductorSecondStowaway
Have you heard the Inspector's latest theory?#Player

Why no, I haven't!#Conductor
People often forget to update me on these things. 
Please, tell me!

*['He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and they committed the murder?']
->ConductorSecondStowawayNice
*['He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board.']
->ConductorSecondStowawayRude

=ConductorSecondStowawayNice
He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and that they committed the murder?#Player

I guess that could have happened?#Conductor
I have no clue, I'm afraid.
Sorry I couldn't be of more help. 
->ConductorIntro

=ConductorSecondStowawayRude
He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board#Player

How dare you suggest that?#Conductor

I didn't suggest it, the inspec-#Player

I run a tight ship here, Skipper!#Conductor
Nothing goes on without me knowing!

(No-one said you didn't know about it)#Commentary
Of course not.#Player
Sorry for bringing it up. 

You'd better be sorry!#Conductor
Look, I have to go now -
Turnip needs some comforting
He doesn't care for accusations either. 
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorSomeoneUp
The Steward saw someone up after bedtime last night.#Player
Dragging something...
Do you know anything about that?

I'm afraid not, Skipper. #Conductor
Again -
I'm stuck in this engine room. 
Just me.
Alone. 
With no one else.
I don't have a lot of hot goss to share. 
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorStoctor
There's an update in the case Conductor! #Player
The dead body we found is actually the Doctor!
And the man dressed up as the Doctor is the stowaway in diguise!

WHAT?! #Conductor
NO!!
Do you think the stowaway is the murderer??

I'm still working on that, Cap'n. #Player

*['Does this kind of thing happen often?']
->HappenOften
*['Did you know about the stowaway?']
->DidYouKnow

=HappenOften
Does this kind of thing happen often? #Player
The people-sneaking-on-board thing
Not the people-murdering-people things

...Sometimes. #Conductor
It's not normally an issue!
There are lots of good people who can't afford a ticket
Or who the other passengers would look down upon
They don't have a way to ride this beautiful train without bending the rules a bit!

Have you ever bent the rules, Captain? #Player

...Perhaps once or twice. #Conductor
Only for close friends. 
And no passengers have ever found out!
But please don't tell anyone. 

I won't. #Player

->ConductorIntro
=DidYouKnow
Did you know about the Stowaway, Captain? #Player
Maybe even...
Let them on board?

NO. #Conductor
They were found stealing. 
I would never knowingly let a thief on board my train.
This job is my life,
I wouldn't risk my career for something like that.
