===ConductorDescription
The Conductor is a middle-aged woman who is very proud of this train. #Commentary
She thinks she is a sea captain, and although you haven't seen her since boarding the train, other passengers say she wears an old sailors hat on her head. 
You talk to her through a rusty intercom.

===ConductorWhatHappened
Hello? #Player
Is this thing on?

-Bzzt-#Conductor
Roger! 
This is the Conductor, at your service!
How can I help you?

Hello Mrs Conductor Lady!#Player

Oh please, no need for the formalities!#Conductor
Call me Captain!

...Like, a boat captain?#Player

Exactly!#Conductor
Now what do you want, skipper?
I'm pretty busy up here!

I wanted to ask you what happened last night as you remember it?#Player

Of course!#Conductor
Well, naturally, I was stuck in here the whole night
(I always miss out on the parties)
But I heard you guests had a...
Shindig?
Is that what the kids call it these days?

Shindig is good. #Player
Or soiree.
Both very hip.

Right!#Conductor
Well all I know is the booze supplies took quite a hit
Always brings out the worst in people, it seems.

That matches up with what I remember. #Player
So you were really stuck in there the whole time?

I'm afraid so, skipper#Conductor
Just the two of us 

Two of you?#Player

Oh yes!#Conductor
Turnip!
My wife's cat often joins me on my shifts.
He's a bit of a blighter but a jolly good first mate nonetheless.

Are cats allowed on fancy cross-country trains?#Player

...Yes.#Conductor

===ConductorWhodunnit
As the head of this fine locomotive-#Player

She's more than fine she is superb!#Conductor

She is indeed!#Player
Well, do you have any idea who may have done this?

I'm afraid not#Conductor
Being holed up in here I haven't seen much of the action.
But rest assured they will be dealt with when we arrive!
You have my word.

I appreciate that.#Player

One more thing -#Conductor
You should talk to someone more involved. 
Maybe the Steward.

Hm?#Player

Yes, he's a good lad.#Conductor
A bit odd, Perhaps
But I trust him wholeheartedly.
->ConductorWhodunnitEnd
=ConductorWhodunnitEnd

Thank you for all your help.#Player

No problemo, skipper.#Conductor

===ConductorSecondStowaway
Have you heard the Inspector's latest theory?#Player

Why no, I haven't!#Conductor
People often forget to update me on these things. 
Please, tell me!

*['He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and they committed the murder?']
->ConductorSecondStowawayNice
*['He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board.']
->ConductorSecondStowawayRude

=ConductorSecondStowawayNice
He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and that they committed the murder?#Player

I guess that could have happened?#Conductor
I have no clue, I'm afraid.
Sorry I couldn't be of more help. 
->ConductorIntro

=ConductorSecondStowawayRude
He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board#Player

How dare you suggest that?#Conductor

I didn't suggest it, the inspec-#Player

I run a tight ship here, Skipper!#Conductor
Nothing goes on without me knowing!

(No-one said you didn't know about it)#Commentary
Of course not.#Player
Sorry for bringing it up. 

You'd better be sorry!#Conductor
Look, I have to go now -
Turnip needs some comforting
He doesn't care for accusations either. 
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorSomeoneUp
The Steward saw someone up after bedtime last night.#Player
Dragging something...
Do you know anything about that?

I'm afraid not, Skipper. #Conductor
Again -
I'm stuck in this engine room. 
I don't have a lot of hot goss to share.
