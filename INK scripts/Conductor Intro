===ConductorDescription
The Conductor is a middle-aged woman who is very proud of this train. 
She thinks she is a sea captain, and although you haven't seen her since boarding the train, other passengers say she wears an old sailors hat on her head. 
You talk to her through a rusty intercom.

===ConductorWhatHappened
Hello? 
Is this thing on?

-Bzzt-
Roger! 
This is the Conductor, at your service!
How can I help you?

Hello Mrs Conductor Lady!

Oh please, no need for the formalities!
Call me Captain!

...Like, a boat captain?

Exactly!
Now what do you want, skipper?
I'm pretty busy up here!

I wanted to ask you what happened last night as you remember it?

Of course!
Well, naturally, I was stuck in here the whole night
(I always miss out on the parties)
But I heard you guests had a...
Shindig?
Is that what the kids call it these days?

Shindig is good. 
Or soiree.
Both very hip.

Right!
Well all I know is the booze supplies took quite a hit
Always brings out the worst in people, it seems.

That matches up with what I remember. 
So you were really stuck in there the whole time?

I'm afraid so, skipper
Just the two of us 

Two of you?

Oh yes!
Turnip!
My wife's cat often joins me on my shifts.
He's a bit of a blighter but a jolly good first mate nonetheless.

Are cats allowed on fancy cross-country trains?

...Yes.

As the head of this fine locomotive-

She's more than fine she is superb!

She is indeed!
Well, do you have any idea who may have done this?

I'm afraid not
Being holed up in here I haven't seen much of the action.
But rest assured they will be dealt with when we arrive!
You have my word.

I appreciate that.

One more thing -
You should talk to someone more involved. 
Maybe the Steward.

Hm?

Yes, he's a good lad.
A bit odd, Perhaps
But I trust him wholeheartedly.

Thank you for all your help.

No problemo, skipper.
