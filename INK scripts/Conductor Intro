===ConductorDescription
The Conductor is a middle-aged woman who is very proud of this train. #Commentary
She thinks she is a sea captain, and although you haven't seen her since boarding the train, other passengers say she wears an old sailors hat on her head. 
You talk to her through a rusty intercom.

===ConductorWhatHappened
Hello? #Player
Is this thing on?

-Bzzt-#Conductor
Roger! 
This is the Conductor, at your service!
How can I help you?

Hello Mrs Conductor Lady!#Player

Oh please, no need for the formalities!#Conductor
Call me Captain!

...Like, a boat captain?#Player

Exactly!#Conductor
Now what do you want, skipper?
I'm pretty busy up here!

I wanted to ask you what happened last night as you remember it?#Player

Of course!#Conductor
Well, naturally, I was stuck in here the whole night
(I always miss out on the parties)
But I heard you guests had a...
Shindig?
Is that what the kids call it these days?

Shindig is good. #Player
Or soiree.
Both very hip.

Right!#Conductor
Well all I know is the booze supplies took quite a hit
Always brings out the worst in people, it seems.

That matches up with what I remember. #Player
So you were really stuck in there the whole time?

I'm afraid so, skipper#Conductor
We do get awfully bored

We?#Player

...We as in me!#Conductor
The royal we!

...That's not a thing.#Player

->ConductorIntro
===ConductorWhodunnit
As the head of this fine locomotive-#Player

She's more than fine she is superb!#Conductor

She is indeed!#Player
Well, do you have any idea who may have done this?

I'm afraid not#Conductor
Being holed up in here we haven't seen much of the action.
But rest assured they will be dealt with when we arrive!
You have my word.

I appreciate that.#Player
{not StewardWhodunnit:

}
=ConductorSuggestSteward
One more thing -#Conductor
You should talk to someone more involved. 
Maybe the Steward.

Hm?#Player

Yes, he's a good lad.#Conductor
A bit odd, Perhaps
But I trust him wholeheartedly.
->ConductorWhodunnitEnd
=ConductorWhodunnitEnd

Thank you for all your help.#Player

No problemo, skipper.#Conductor

->ConductorIntro

===ConductorSecondStowaway
Have you heard the Inspector's latest theory?#Player

Why no, I haven't!#Conductor
People often forget to update me on these things. 
Please, tell me!

*['He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and they committed the murder?']
->ConductorSecondStowawayNice
*['He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board.']
->ConductorSecondStowawayRude

=ConductorSecondStowawayNice
He thinks maybe a second stowaway is on board, and that they committed the murder?#Player

I guess that could have happened?#Conductor
I have no clue, I'm afraid.
Sorry I couldn't be of more help. 
->ConductorIntro

=ConductorSecondStowawayRude
He reckons you've let a murderer sneak on board#Player

How dare you suggest that?#Conductor

I didn't suggest it, the inspec-#Player

I run a tight ship here, Skipper!#Conductor
Nothing goes on without me knowing!

(No-one said you didn't know about it)#Commentary
Of course not.#Player
Sorry for bringing it up. 

You'd better be sorry!#Conductor
Look, I have to go now -
Turnip needs some comforting
He doesn't care for accusations either. 
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorSomeoneUp
The Steward saw someone up after bedtime last night.#Player
Dragging something...
Do you know anything about that?

I'm afraid not, Skipper. #Conductor
Again -
I'm stuck in this engine room. 
Just me.
Alone. 
With no one else.
I don't have a lot of hot goss to share. 
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorStoctor
There's an update in the case Conductor! #Player
The dead body we found is actually the Doctor!
And the man dressed up as the Doctor is the stowaway in diguise!

WHAT?! #Conductor
NO!!
Do you think the stowaway is the murderer??

I'm still working on that, Cap'n. #Player

*['Does this kind of thing happen often?']
->HappenOften
*['Did you know about the stowaway?']
->DidYouKnow

=HappenOften
Does this kind of thing happen often? #Player
The people-sneaking-on-board thing
Not the people-murdering-people things

...Sometimes. #Conductor
It's not normally an issue!
There are lots of good people who can't afford a ticket
Or who the other passengers would look down upon
They don't have a way to ride this beautiful train without bending the rules a bit!

Have you ever bent the rules, Captain? #Player

...Perhaps once or twice. #Conductor
Only for close friends. 
And no passengers have ever found out!
But please don't tell anyone. 

I won't. #Player

->ConductorIntro
=DidYouKnow
Did you know about the Stowaway, Captain? #Player
Maybe even...
Let them on board?

NO. #Conductor
They were found stealing. 
I would never knowingly let a thief on board my train.
This job is my life,
I wouldn't risk my career for something like that.
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorSus
Hello again, Captain. #Player

Howdy, Skipper! #Conductor
Got any updates for us?

{not ConductorStoctor.HappenOften:
-> Accusation
-else: 
->BendTheRules
}

=Accusation
Some people are suggesting that you've had something to do with this #Player

WHAT?! #Conductor
WHO??

The Lady... #Player
She thinks you helped the stowaway sneak on board
And then remain hidden
After the murder

That woman is so quick to judge!#Conductor
I get the feeling she's eager to blame anything on 'the staff'...
Thanks for letting me know, Skipper
->ConductorIntro

=BendTheRules
Well...#Player
You know you said you've...
Bent the rules before?

...Yes? #Conductor

...Have you snuck someone on board before?#Player

...Yes. #Conductor

...Did you sneak someone on board for this journey?#Player

...Maybe. #Conductor
But not the stowaway!
No-one nefarious!!

Who is it?#Player

...Come say hello then.#Conductor
...
(MEOW)

...Is that a cat? #Player

Yep. #Conductor
This is Turnip. 
He's my wife's cat
When she's at work he rides with me

Ooooh #Player

Yeah.#Conductor
It's not technically allowed
ESPECIALLY not when the Lady has Mr. Lionel with her
But he's not hurting anyone when he's hidden in here. 

That's fair enough.#Player
Sorry I doubted you.
Give him a boop from me

You can boop him youself when we arrive #Conductor

YAY! #Player
Thanks Captain
->ConductorIntro

===ConductorLadySus
The Inspector thinks Lady Mortimer is hiding anything. #Player
I don't suppose you have any intel on her?

Ooh I actually do this time!#Conductor
Since her cabin is the closest to the engine room I can hear things sometimes
Mainly that dang bird

{ConductorSus.BendTheRules:
It drives poor Turnip here insane!
I'm half tempted to let him loose so he can silence that thing...
}

{LadySomeonesUp || LadySus.LastNight:
That could actually be very useful! #Player
Lady Mortimer claims she was in her room all night
And Mr Lionel was screeching constantly until the early hours. 
Does that match up with what you heard?

Oh yes that bird was a nightmare last night! #Conductor
Far worse than usual!
...Apart from a 40 minute window, now you mention it

Really?!#Player

Yes!#Conductor
He was non-stop until around 11.20 when he suddenly...
stopped. 
It was about 40 minutes of absolute bliss!
I was hoping the old thing had finally croaked

The bird or the bitch?#Player

Oh shush you.#Conductor
The bird. 
But it started up again just before midnight.
She must have taken it for a stroll through the cabin or something.

-else:
Did you hear anything unusual from her cabin last night?#Player

Nothing of note, I'm afraid.#Conductor
Not much gets through the walls, just that bloomin birdbrain.
}

->ConductorIntro

===ConductorInspectorSus
The Steward thinks Sands may have had a hand in the murder. #Player
What do you think?

The Inspector?#Conductor
Eh I doubt it. 
He's fiery,
But he isn't smart, mean, or organised enough to do something like this
